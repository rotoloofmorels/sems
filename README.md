**SEMS (Satellite-based Environment Monitoring System)** uses satellite images and segmentation techniques to determine natural features affected by encroachment. This can be due to industrial interference, as well as construction activities taking place in the vicinity of foliage, water bodies and other features of the ecosystem.

1. The Python Notebook represents the working segmentation model, which can be readily tested supplied with satellite images.
2. The demo application can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tVAjvCkCN-ihsVQoFRFcnNg8h6sXA33U/view?usp=sharing
3. Documents relevant to the Enzen Hackathon are in a separate folder.
