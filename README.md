**SEMS (Satellite-based Environment Monitoring System)** uses satellite images and segmentation techniques to determine natural features affected by encroachment. This can be due to industrial interference, as well as construction activities taking place in the vicinity of foliage, water bodies and other features of the ecosystem.

1. The Python Notebook represents the working segmentation model, which can be readily tested supplied with satellite images.
2. Installation:

```npm install
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
**Frameworks used:** Node, Babel, ESLint, SASS, jQuery, python-keras, Flask

3. The demo application can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tVAjvCkCN-ihsVQoFRFcnNg8h6sXA33U/view?usp=sharing
4. Code for various segmentation algorithm components can be found in /codes.
5. Trained Python models can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R-J4jjJjcFAXmmnqKKwVHEiLTvh8NSq1
Segmentation algorithms in the code files can be run using these models.
4. Documents relevant to the Enzen Hackathon are in a separate folder.
